# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a creative young developer always searching for opportunities and challenges where I can put my hard work.
During my free time I really like to test things I have never done before like hiking and developing Video Games.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a lot about learning to broaden my horizons and never be focused by one thing.
From my work-life I have mainly worked with an Agile Team, and I really like working this way, but I think I can handle things on my own.<br>
<h5><b>I am sure together we can do a lot !</b></h5>'
