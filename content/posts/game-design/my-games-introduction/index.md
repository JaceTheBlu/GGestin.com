My n°1 Hobby is **Game Development**

## Who am I?

Web Developer the day and Game Developer the night, I actually never quit my computer ! I'm really interested in beautiful code and complex random algorithms !

## Why doing GameJams?

Because it's fun ! Really that's it, this is a game you can't loose, you at least learned something :)

## Working alone?

Not at all ! I'm not doing my jams alone, my crew is here to help me ! The "One More Game Studio", composed by [PtitlLu](https://ptitllu.itch.io/), [TheSaltyChild](https://itch.io/profile/thesaltychild) and [Myself](https://jacetheblu.itch.io/) ❤️
