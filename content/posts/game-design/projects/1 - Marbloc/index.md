## 1. Context
This game was my first real project from scratch. The plan was to create a game without constraints to explore what I learned with Unity. I created it with Lucas in about a week.

This project seems a bit like a draft because (first yeah it's a draft) and mostly because we created it with coding in mind, less game design, more technology.
For exemple the terrain is fully randomised (The height of each block is random, and with that the color of the "tile" is more or less intense). 
Then the walls that are shooting projectile are picking a random tile in their array to shoot (except they all shoot the same because unity random).
The movement for the marble was quite stiff to code because :
- we wanted some kind of realism in the movement, interaction with gravity...
- But the game had to be playabe and fun
With that in mind we did what we could to find the balance between fun/realim/difficulty and the result is... early access. With some hindsight we could have done better, but it what it is !

This project was a very fun and positive project to begin with.
