## 1. The Service
*It's loading below ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è*

<iframe src="stream.html" style="height:75vmin; width:100%; border:none; overflow:hidden ;"></iframe>

## 2. The Concept
### a. Why ?
I just wanted a way to share a live on my website, for many reasons :
- Being able to share my screen when I am coding and doing some stuffs in group.
- Try to make it work, for science !
- Being able to "emulate" a living room with my friends to look at video in the same time


### b. Technology
The Technology behind this embedded stream is : [YoloLiv](https://yololiv.com) a service that given a RTMP Key (Standart Key for streaming with a software like [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/) or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)) make it possible to embed the live in any website.
